They keep walking and Gandalf appears as he is reborn as Gandalf the White after his previous death in The Fellowship of the Ring. They fight Isengard with the help of Gandalf. Wormtongue tries to kill Gandalf by throwing an object called the palantir which is a magic seeing-stone. Pippin looks into the Palatir which makes it so Sauron would know his location and try to pursue him. Frodo and Sam meets Gollum, the previous ring-bearer before Bilbo as he is still looking for the ring. Gollum finds out that Frodo has the ring and tries to help Frodo and Sam with their journey to gain trust. As much as Gollum has corrupted Frodo's mind into trusting him, Sam still does not believe him as much. They went to the Black Gate of Mordor and found out it was closed. They later meet Faramir and Faramir is suspicious of the Hobbits for killing Boromir. They tell the truth and Gollum nearly gets killed but Frodo saves Gollum.
