<h2 id="middleearth">The Book</h2>
<div id="meplacer"><p id="metext"><u>Chapter 1-6:</u> It starts with Bilbo, A Hobbit that loves the comforts of home. His home is named "Bag End" created by his dad. His dad passed it on to him. He does not think about going on an adventure and Gandalf brings him on an adventure. He meets the dwarves who are trying to reclaim their homeland named "Erebor". When they leave they encounter hardships and life threathening things such as meeting stone trolls, elves of Rivendell and goblins. Bilbo meets an unusual creature that holds the One Ring of Power which leads on to the story of "The Lord of the Rings".</p>

<p id="metext"><u>Chapter 7-12:</u> They escape the Goblins and encounter a big huge skin changer named Beorn. Beorn originally hates dwarves but eventually sides with the dwarves of Erebor since he hates orcs and Goblins way more. Gandalf explains their adventure to Beorn and his interest is piqued. He starts to side with the dwarves and help them. They leave Beorns place and pass the Mirkwood Forest. Bombur falls into the enchanted river due to its spell. They keep walking and eventually meet the Elves of the Woodland Realm. They wanted to figure out about Thorin's quest. He refuses to tell them and Thranduil, the king locks them up into cells. Luckily Bilbo was wearing his one ring and he sneaked in and did not get locked up. He took them out of the cells and nearly escaped. They met with Laketown and gave a promise to Laketown. They are off for Erebor and arrive at the door. Bilbo goes in as their official burglar with his ring on to look for the "Arkenstone", which is the heart of the mountain. Smaug notices him and eventually Bilbo takes off the ring. Smaug tries to kill him, Bilbo escapes and Smaug goes to off to Laketown.</p>

<p id="metext"><u>Chapter 13-19:</u> Smaug makes his way to laketown and spreads fire across the small town. He eventually gets killed by Bard. The dwarves make their way into the lonely mountain. Thorin asks everyone to go around and look for the Arkenstone. Bilbo does find it, but he hides it from Thorin and he knew it would be better if he didn't have the Arkenstone. Thorin doesn't find it and he gets mad. He gets the same sickness as his ancestors have gotten which is dragon sickness, greediness over gold. He meets with the others and they gang up for the battle of the fives armies but when Band asked for his promise back, Thorin didn't accept it. He was already corrupted by the gold. Everyone saw it. Bilbo gave the elves and Bard the Arkenstone and told them to use it to try and stop te battle between dwarves, men and elves. The adventure is eventually over and Bilbo goes home back to The Shire and Gandalf sees that Bilbo was definitely a different hobbit than he once were.</p>

<h2 id="middleearth">Differences in the Movie</h2>
<div id="meplacer"><p id="metext"><u>The Hobbit An Unexpected Journey/Chapters 1-6:</u> Some differences is that in the movie, Gandalf does not actually bring Bilbo and tell him to go on the adventure. Gandalf leaves with the company at night and Bilbo wakes up in the morning to realize he wanted to go and not stay. During the duration of the movies, a pale orc named Azog the Defiler is trying to kill the entire dwarf scum so when they are chased at the end of chapter 6, in the movies they are chased by Azog instead of golbins. In the movie, Gandalf commands a butterfly to tell the Lord of the Eagles to come but in the book, the Lord of the Eagles will sense it themselves that people are in danger.<b> Click on the image to see "The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey" trailer!</b></p>

<div id="meplacer"><p id="metext"><u>The Desolation of Smaug/Chapter 7-12:</u> They start on their journey to mirkwood and there are a lot of scenes that were not in the book that got added into this movie. They added some "necromancer" things which he can summon the dead and do some deadly things. He appears as the more powerful <i>Sauron</i> in the Lord of the Rings.<b> Click on the image to see "The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug" trailer!</b></p>

<div id="meplacer"><p id="metext"><u>The Battle of the Five Armies/Chapter 13-19:</u> This film added more of the necromancer and Azog things as they were not in the books. Azog gets killed at the end of the film as he doesn't exist in the book. A she-elf got added in(which many Tolkien fans strongly dislike) named Tauriel. They have a very unsupportive love triangle that no one wants to mention again and thats the worst part of the films for me. The battle of the five armies in the book only lasts a page long while the battle in the movies makes almost half of the movie if not 3/4 of it. The ending with Bilbo coming home is pretty much almost the same. The fact also that the movies got split into three explains how much they possibly added to the films that just were not in the book.<b> Click on the image to see "The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies" trailer!</b></p>
