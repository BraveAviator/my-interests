<div class="flex-container">
      <div><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bd/Vivaldi.jpg/1200px-Vivaldi.jpg" width="80%">
      <p><u>Antonio Vivaldi (1678–1741):</u> He is an Italian composer and violinist of the Baroque period. He wrote music for operas, solo instruments, and small ensembles, but he is often celebrated for his concerti, in which the solo passages alternate with passages for the whole orchestra. He wrote about 500 concerti, of which his best-known work is the group of four violin concerti titled The Four Seasons. His Mandolin Concerto in C Major, RV 425, Concerto for Four Violins and Cello in B Minor, Op. 3, No.10 and Concerto for Two Trumpets in C Major are equally playful and complex.</p></div>
      <div><img src="https://cdn.britannica.com/w:400,h:300,c:crop/61/114461-050-E9206DB5/Johann-Sebastian-Bach-oil-canvas-Elias-Gottlieb-1746.jpg" width="80%"><p><u>Johann Sebastian Bach (1685–1750):</u> Johann Sebastian Bach was a German composer and organist of the Baroque period. His contemporary pieces admired him for his talent as a musician but were known to be very old fashioned. His work was rediscovered in the 19th century which led to the Bach-revival and he became to be the greatest composers of all time. His most celebrated compositions include Brandenburg Concertos, The Well-Tempered Clavier, BWV 846–893, Suites for Unaccompanied Cello, BWV 1007–1012, Orchestral Suites, BWV 1066–1069, and Mass in B Minor, BWV 232.</p></div>
      <div><img src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b83c1176a496042b5228c764b40e4955420235b1/143_337_2520_1513/master/2520.jpg?width=1200&height=1200&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&s=5de591e946b99046a5e2fd20169c544e" width="80%">
      <p><u>Joseph Haydn(1732–1809):</u> The Austrian composer Joseph Haydn was one of the most important figures in the development of the Classical style of music during the 18th century. He helped establish forms and styles for symphonies and string quartets. Haydn was a prolific composer, and some of his most well-known works are Symphony No. 92 in G Major, Emperor Quartet, and Cello Concerto No. 2 in D Major. His compositions are often characterized as light, witty, and elegant.</p></div>
      <div><img src="https://cdn.britannica.com/35/74835-050-F0B71060/canvas-oil-Wolfgang-Amadeus-Mozart-Barbara-Krafft-1819.jpg" width="80%"><p><u>Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (1756–91):</u> He is an Austrian composer from the classical period and is widely recognized as one of the greatest composers in Western music. He is the only composer to write and excel in all of the musical genres of his time. He is rumored to be able to play music at the age of three and to write music at age five. He began his career as a child prodigy. Notable compositions include The Marriage of Figaro, Elvira Madigan, and Clarinet Quintet in A Major, K 581.</p></div>
      <div><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6e/Joseph_Karl_Stieler%27s_Beethoven_mit_dem_Manuskript_der_Missa_solemnis.jpg/1200px-Joseph_Karl_Stieler%27s_Beethoven_mit_dem_Manuskript_der_Missa_solemnis.jpg" width="80%">
      <p><u>Ludwig van Beethoven (1770–1827):</u> He is a German composer and pianist and is widely regarded as the greatest composer who ever lived. He expanded the classical traditions from Haydn which was one of his teachers and Mozart. He also experimented with his own personal expression which is a characteristic that influences the Romantic Era. His career was marked with progressive deafness but that did not stop him from composing some of his most important works during the last ten years of his life. He widened the scope of sonata, symphony, concerto, and quartets. Beethoven’s notable works include Symphony No. 9 in D Minor, Op. 125, Symphony No. 5 in C Minor, Op. 67, Moonlight Sonata, and Für Elise.</p></div>
      <div><img src="https://cdn.britannica.com/60/140360-050-A2E7778E/LA-Bisson-Frederic-Chopin-detail-photo-publisher-1849.jpg" width="80%">
      <p><u>Frédéric Chopin(1810–49):</u> He was a Polish French composer and a pianist of the Romatic period. He was one of few composers to devote himself to a single instrument, and his sensitive approach to the keyboard allowed him to exploit all the resources of the piano, including innovations in fingering and pedaling. He is thus primarily known for writing music for the piano, notably Nocturne, Op. 9 No. 2 in E-flat Major, Nocturne in C-sharp Minor, B. 49, and Heroic Polonaise.</p></div>
      <div><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9d/RichardWagner.jpg" width="80%">
      <p><u>Richard Wagner(1813–83):</u> He is a German composer and theorist and extended the opera tradition and revolutionized Western music. His dramatic compositions are particularly known for the use of leitmotifs, brief musical motifs for a character, place, or event, which he skillfully transformed throughout a piece. His notable works include operas The Flying Dutchman, Tannhäuser, Lohengrin, Tristan and Isolde, Parsifal, and the tetralogy The Ring of the Nibelung, which includes The Valkyrie. One of the most controversial figures in classical music, his work transcends his character, which was defined by megalomaniac tendencies and anti-Semitic views.</p></div>
      <div><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/15/JohannesBrahms.jpg" width="80%">
      <p><u>Johannes Brahms(1833–97):</u> He is a German composer and pianist from the Romantic period. He was more disciple of the classical tradition. He wrote in many genres, including symphonies, concerti, chamber music, piano works, and choral compositions. Many revealed the influence of folk music. Some of his best-known works include Symphony No. 3 in F Major, Wiegenlied, Op. 49, No. 4, and Hungarian Dances.</p></div>
      <div><img src="https://cdn.britannica.com/29/70029-004-74AD88C3/Pyotr-Ilyich-Tchaikovsky-St-Petersburg-Russia-1887.jpg" width="80%">
      <p><u>Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky (1840–93):</u> Writing music with broad emotional appeal during the Romantic period, Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky became one of the most popular Russian composers of all time. He was schooled in Western Europe tradition and assimilated elements from French, Italian, and German music with a personal and Russian style. Some of his best-known works were composed for the ballet, including Swan Lake, The Sleeping Beauty, and The Nutcracker, Op. 71, but they also include Piano Concerto No. 1 in B-flat Minor, Op. 23 and Marche Slave, Op. 31.</p></div>

Debussy developed new and complex harmonies and musical structures that evoke comparisons to the art of his contemporary Impressionist and Symbolist painters and writers. His major works include Clair de lune, La Mer, Prelude to the Afternoon of a Faun, and the opera Pelléas et Mélisande.</p></div></center>
