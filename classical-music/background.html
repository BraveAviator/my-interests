<center><h1>The Background of Classical Music</h1>
<div id="placer"><p>The main classical era is around 1750–1820 but there are seven main eras of classical music. Medieval period(1150 to 1400), Renaissance period(1400 to 1600), Baroque period(1600 to 1750), Classical period(1750 to 1820), Romantic period(1820 to 1900), Modern period(1900 to 1930) and Postmodern period(1930 to today).</div>
  <h2 id="script">Medieval Period (1150 to 1400)</h2>
  <div id="placer"><p>Music has existed during this early time when human civilization was put into place. Medieval music is known for the monophonic chant also known as the Gregorian chant due to the use of it by Gregorian monks. In addition, they played intruments such as the lute, flute, recorder and selected string instruments.</p>

  <h2 id="script">Renaissance period (1400 to 1600)</h2>
  <p>The Renaissance period introduced polyphonic music to more people mostly through choral music which were performed in liturgical settings. In addition to the lute, more instruments were made and they also played viol, rebec, lyre, and guitar among other string instruments. Brass instruments started to come into place as the sackbut and cornet emerged during this era. Some notable composer from the Renaissance period are Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina, John Dowland, and Thomas Tallis.</p>

  <h2 id="script">Baroque period (1600 to 1750)</h2>
  <p>During the Baroque period, classical music started to gain it's complexity and having full embrace in tonal music and music based on major and minor scales rather than just modes. Many instruments used today were crafted during this period and were common. Instruments such as violin, viola, cello, contrabass (double bass), bassoon, and oboe were used during this period. Harpsichord was the dominant keyboard during this era but the piano was also emerged during this era. Some known composers during early Baroque era include Alessandro Scarlatti and Henry Purcell. Some well known composers during the late Baroque era include Antonio Vivaldi, Dominico Scarlatti, George Frideric Handel, and Georg Philipp Telemann. The most influencial composer from the Baroque period who is very well known is Johann Sebastian Bach, who composed extensive preludes, fugues, cantatas, and organ music.</p>

  <h2 id="script">Classical period (1750 to 1820)</h2>
  <p>A broad area of the classical music genre existed during this period. This era of music marked the first time that the symphony, the instrumental concerto (which highlights virtuoso soloists), and the sonata form were brought to wide audiences. The signature classical composer is Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart but he was very far from the only star during this period. Joseph Haydn, Franz Schubert, and J.S. Bach's sons J.C. Bach and C.P.E. Bach were also stars during this period. Opera composers like Mozart and Christoph Willibald Gluck developed operatic form into a style that remains very recognizable to this day. Beethoven began to start his career during the classical era but he enhanced the next musical era more.</p>

  <h2 id="script">Romantic period (1820 to 1900)</h2>
  <p>The Romantic period introduced emotion and drama to the platonic beauty of Classical period music. Beethoven composed many symphonies during the early romantic period. Beethoven's Symphony No. 9 set a template for nearly all nineteenth-century music that followed. Some well known composers who were dominating the romantic era were Frederic Chopin, Franz Liszt, Felix Mendelssohn, Hector Berlioz, Robert Schumann, Johannes Brahms, Anton Bruckner, Gustav Mahler, Peter Ilyich Tchaikovsky, Richard Strauss, Jean Sibelius, and Sergei Rachmaninoff. Opera composers like Richard Wagner, Giuseppe Verdi, and Giacomo Puccini used Romanticism's emotional power to create beautiful melodic lines sung in Italian and German. During the romantic era, there was a new addition to the woodwind family, the saxophone which gained prominence the next era.</p>

  <h2 id="script">Modern period (1900 to 1930)</h2>
  <p>The Modern era of art and music came about in the early twentieth century. Classical composers of the early twentieth century reveled in breaking the harmonic and structural rules that had governed previous forms of classical music. Igor Stravinsky stretched the instruments to their limits. He embraced mixed meter, and challenged traditional notions of tonality in works like The Rite of Spring.Claude Debussy and Maurice Ravel led a subgenre of the 20th century called Impressionism. Dimitri Shostakovich, Paul Hindemith, and Béla Bartók stuck with classical forms like the piano concerto and the sonata, but challenged harmonic traditions. Perhaps most radical was the German composer Arnold Schoenberg who, along with disciples like Alban Berg and Anton Webern, disposed of tonality altogether and embraced serial (or 12-tone) music.</p>

  <h2 id="script">Postmodern period (1930 to today)</h2>
  <p>The art music of the twentieth century shifted starting in the 1930s and continuing into the post-World War II era, ushering in a style of music that is sometimes called postmodern or contemporary. Olivier Messiaen combined classical forms with new instruments like the ondes martenot. Pierre Boulez, Witold Lutoslawski, Krzysztof Penderecki, Henryk Górecki, György Ligeti, Philip Glass, Steve Reich, John Adams, and Christopher Rouse blended the lines between tonal and atonal music, and they’ve blurred the lines between classical music and other forms like rock and jazz.</p>
